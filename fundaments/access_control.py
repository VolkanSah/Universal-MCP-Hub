    Asynchronous class for managing access control.
    It builds directly on the functions of your secure database module.
    This is the layer that uses the foundation without modifying it.

    How to extend this class:
    To add new functionality, simply create a new asynchronous method
    within this class. This method can call the `db.execute_secured_query`
    function to interact with the database. For example:

    async def get_user_last_login(self):
        sql = "SELECT last_login FROM users WHERE id = $1"
        result = await db.execute_secured_query(sql, self.user_id, fetch_method='fetchrow')
        return result['last_login'] if result else None
    """
    def __init__(self, user_id: Optional[int] = None):
        self.user_id = user_id

    async def has_permission(self, permission_name: str) -> bool:
        """

        Uses the secure execute_secured_query function from the foundation.

        # has a role (user_role_assignments) that is linked to a permission
        # (role_permissions) which has the specified name (user_permissions.name).
