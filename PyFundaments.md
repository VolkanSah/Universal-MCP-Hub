# PyFundaments: A Secure Python Architecture
##### v. 1.0.1 dev

## Description

This project, named **PyFundaments**, provides a robust and secure Python architecture. Its core mission is not to be a monolithic framework, but to establish a layered, modular foundation—or "fundament"—of essential services. This structure ensures that every application starts on a verified and secure base, with a focus on stability, code clarity, and a security-first mindset from the ground up.

> [!NOTE]  
> you must create your app/bot in app/* or you get an error! Than uncoment
> ```
>from app.app import start_application
>await start_application(fundaments)
>```
> in main.py

## The Role of `main.py`

`main.py` is the **only entry point** and acts as the first line of defense for the application.

### Responsibilities

  - [x] **Validate Dependencies**: It checks for all necessary core modules in `fundaments/` and exits immediately if any are missing.
  - [x] **Conditional Environment Loading**: It uses the `config_handler` to load available configuration variables and initializes only the services for which configuration is present.
  - [x] **Initialize Services**: It creates instances of available services (PostgreSQL, encryption, access control, user handling) based on environment configuration, collecting them into a single service dictionary.
  - [x] **Graceful Degradation**: Services that cannot be initialized are skipped with warnings, allowing applications to run with partial functionality.
  - [x] **Decouple App Logic**: It hands off the prepared and verified services to `app/app.py`, allowing the main application to focus purely on its business logic without worrying about low-level setup.

-----

## Configuration (`.env`)

Application settings are managed using a `.env` file. **Never commit this file to version control.**

The framework uses **conditional loading** - only services with available configuration are initialized. This allows different application types to use only what they need.

A `.env.example` file is provided to show available variables. Create a copy named `.env` and configure only what your application requires.

### Core Configuration (Optional based on app type)

```text
# Database connection (required only for database-using apps)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require"

# Encryption keys (required only for apps using encryption)
MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your_256_bit_key_here"
PERSISTENT_ENCRYPTION_SALT="your_unique_salt_here"

# Logging configuration (optional)
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
LOG_TO_TMP="false"
ENABLE_PUBLIC_LOGS="true"
```

### Application Examples

**Discord Bot:** Only needs `BOT_TOKEN`, no database or encryption required.
**ML Pipeline:** Only needs `DATABASE_URL` for data access.
**Web Application:** May need all services for full functionality.

-----

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

-----

## Getting Started

1.  **Configure**: Create your `.env` file from the `.env.example` and set only the variables your application type requires.
2.  **Run**: Execute the `main.py` script to start the application.

```bash
python main.py
```

The framework will automatically detect available configuration and load only the necessary services.

## Module Documentation

Each security-relevant core module is documented in the `docs/` directory:

| Module              | Description                              | Documentation                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------|
| `access_control.py` | Role-based access management             | [access\_control.py.md](docs/access_control.py.md)|
| `config_handler.py` | Universal configuration loader           | [config\_handler.py.md](docs/config_handler.py.md)|
| `encryption.py`     | Cryptographic routines                   | [encryption.py.md](docs/encryption.py.md)         |
| `postgresql.py`     | Secure, asynchronous database access     | [postgresql.py.md](docs/postgresql.py.md)         |
| `user_handler.py`   | Authentication and identity management   | [user\_handler.py.md](docs/user_handler.py.md)     |

## Changelog 
###### Version 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
### PyFundaments Refactoring

#### Modified Files

**1. main.py - Conditional Service Loading**
- **Added:** Environment-based conditional service initialization
- **Added:** Graceful fallback when services can't be initialized (warning instead of crash)
- **Added:** Conditional logging configuration (LOG_LEVEL, LOG_TO_TMP, ENABLE_PUBLIC_LOGS)
- **Added:** Smart dependency management (access_control & user_handler only load if database available)
- **Added:** Safe shutdown (only close DB pool if it was initialized)
- **Result:** Framework now supports partial service loading for different app types

**2. app/app.py - Proper Service Injection**
- **Removed:** Direct service imports and instantiation
- **Added:** Services received as parameter from main.py
- **Modified:** start_application() now takes fundaments dictionary as parameter
- **Added:** Conditional service usage based on what main.py provides
- **Added:** Examples for different app types (database-only, database-free modes)
- **Result:** Clean separation - main.py handles initialization, app.py uses services

**3. fundaments/config_handler.py - Universal Configuration Loader**
- **Removed:** REQUIRED_KEYS validation (moved to main.py)
- **Modified:** Now loads ALL environment variables without validation
- **Added:** Helper methods: get_bool(), get_int(), has(), get_all()
- **Added:** Safe defaults and type conversion
- **Result:** Config handler never needs updates, works with any ENV variables

**4. .env.example - Conditional Configuration Template**
- **Added:** Clear separation between core and optional dependencies
- **Added:** Logging configuration options
- **Added:** App-specific configuration examples (Discord, ML, Web)
- **Added:** Comments explaining when to use each option
- **Result:** Users only configure what they need, no unused variables

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Conditional Loading:** Framework only loads needed services based on available ENV vars
- **Merge-Safe Structure:** User code (app/, config_handler.py) protected from framework updates
- **Zero Breaking Changes:** Updates only affect fundaments/ directory
- **Enterprise-Level Merging:** Community can safely pull framework updates</document_content></document>
